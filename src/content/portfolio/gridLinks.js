      'A high-end, Greek, natural cosmetics company called ‘Flora & Fauna’ was in the process of rebranding their core range to appeal to a younger audience. They wanted the new packaging designs to feature modern illustrations to represent the raw, natural ingredients that they use within their product range. The client wanted to see an initial design which they would potentially roll out across a larger product range. They were looking for the designs to take inspiration from the Greek Islands. For these designs, I played off of the beautiful pink paper flowers, Bougainvillea, that are native to the Greek Islands. I kept a simple color scheme with illustrations representing the scents, tying it back to the natural ingredients used in the products.',

      "Red Lobster is a restaurant passionate about making high-quality seafood available and affordable to everyone, including people who lived far from the coast. Since the 1960's they have been through a few generations of logos, with the latest one designed in 2009. Coming up on 9 years since their latest design, they needed another logo refresh that still was true to their name. After multiple iterations of lobsters and font faces, two opposite styles were chosen to present.",

    briefCopy:
      '14 to Forever is a non-profit organization based out of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. There is a lack of positive or defined self-image within young girls in the community. Their vision is to empower young women between the ages of 13-19 to discover their God-given identity, develop leadership skills, promote positive relationships, and activate social change. In order for 14 to Forever to properly obtain the funds and volunteers needed for their program, they needed research done and a report written and designed for internal purposes. The final look of this report is minimal and light, intending to focus on photos and the text. ',
